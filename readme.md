## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools to build the project:
* JavaJDK >= 11
* gradle >= 4.4
* git

#### Build preparation

Use the following commands to setup your local source tree:

```bash
git clone ${URL_OF_THIS_REPO}
git submodule update --init --recursive # This will fetch third party dependencies
```

### Installing

Just run
```
gradle jar
```

to create an executable jar file in `build/libs` which will include all runtime dependencies.


### Running the tests

A simple call of
```
gradle test
```

will suffice.


### And coding style tests


```
gradle check
```

will execute the checkstyle plugin which will export any flaws registered.
Results will be available on the command line as well as html exports in `build/reports/checkstyle`.

Please fix all the reported issues before opening merge requests, or start a discussion if you are convinced certain rules are too strict.
